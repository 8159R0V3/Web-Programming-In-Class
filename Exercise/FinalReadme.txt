For the final we were tasked with creating a suggestion box that reads options from the server.
I implemented this on the others.html page and the server.php.
the html page asks for other users to look up how they are doing.
now it has an autocomplete function with all active users taken from my database of users.

the other part of the final was to get my website working in cloud 9 which i havent been able to do.
this is because my login and registration is written in a php file which is problematic since
cloud 9 hasnt been displaying them on the browser. instead it just has the user download the file.
while i could just post the rest of the website thats done in proper format it would not work
since the session is created in index.php. without this file the rest of the pages will not work since
it needs the user information to perform many of the scripts.

while the website doesnt work on cloud 9 the database does. what ive been doing for most of my project
is running on a localhost that i was able to create using xampp. by doing this ive been able to get every thing to work.
